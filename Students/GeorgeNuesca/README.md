#George Nesca Bio (September 11, 2014)

###Presently

With free time from  my _semi-retirement_, I volunteer at [CWB](http://cwb.org) to barter some sailing time, try to play some tennis (although the season is winding down), and galavant around the area or just hang around doing house work. Now I'm looking for something to keep me more interested and excited on a daily and lifelong basis. Hopefully learning Python, and other prorgramming languages, will reinvigorate enthusiam now and for future ventures... And eventually provide me with more disposable income to consume [otoro](http://otoro.com/).

###Workings

I've spent most of my professional career developing RF microwave circuits and assemblies for defense and aerospace communication, navigation, and surveillance applications... From design and manufacturing, to project management and sales. I have no real coding exposure though (unless copying and pasting VB code for a single Excel script counts). In retrospect, a fairly good experience with some interesting moments.

###Formal Education
    
    *Majored in Electrical Engineering, and Minored in Business 
    *Operational efficiencey cred: DFSS Green Belt. Almost earned a Black Belt... Hiya! 
    *Hopefully Code Fellows F2 Python and possibly Python Accelerator!
